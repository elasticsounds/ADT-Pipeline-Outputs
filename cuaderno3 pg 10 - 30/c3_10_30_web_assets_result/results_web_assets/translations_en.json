So, we learn that going to her grandfather's house became something fun for Elena. What do we learn from all this?

        "sectioneli5-21-0": "Here is a fun poem that tells a secret about how to beat the shadows. It says that if you face the sun, the shadow follows you, but it doesn't matter if you run slow (slowly) or fast (light), you will always arrive first.\n\nThe question makes you think about the relationship between \"slow\" and \"light.\" These words are opposites, because \"slow\" means slow and \"light\" means fast or quick.",
        "sectioneli5-21-1": "We are going to learn about words that are opposites and those that are similar.\n\nOpposite words are called *antonyms*.

This helps you practice describing using your imagination.",
        "sectioneli5-22-1": "Let's describe Elena's grandfather using comparisons. Imagine him so others can see him in their minds. For example, his hair is gray like smoke, and we continue comparing him with other fun or interesting things.

Look closely at the drawing, search for those objects, and then write their names. It's like a word treasure hunt with special words.",
        "sectioneli5-24-0": "Today we are going to practice how to use short words called \"pronouns\". These words replace nouns so we don't repeat them too much. For example, if you talk about your \"brother\", you can use \"he\". Elena runs very fun races. You can write \"he\" where it says \"brother\", \"he\" for \"dog\", \"she\" for \"turtle\", and \"he\" for \"dad\". This way we make the text shorter and easier to read. Let's try it together!",
        "sectioneli5-24-1": "In this activity, we are going to change the words we use to talk about people, called pronouns, to the names of those characters. For example, if we say 'she', we will look for who 'she' is in the story and put her name or a description like 'the girl who runs races'. This way, we better understand who we are talking about.",
        "sectioneli5-25-0": "The Sun is like a big ball of fire in the sky that gives us light and warmth. There are other things that can also give light, like light bulbs or candles, and those are lights made by us. Most of the things we see do not have their own light; we see them because the light from something like the Sun bounces off them and reaches our eyes.",
        "sectioneli5-25-1": "Imagine there are three types of things: things that don't let light pass through, things that let some light pass through, and things that let all the light through.\n\nThings that don't let light pass through are called opaque, like a cardboard box. These things create shadows.\n\nThen there are translucent things, which let some light pass through, but you cannot see clearly through them, like frosted glass or nylon.\n\nFinally, transparent things let all the light pass through, and you can see clearly through them, like window glass or the lenses people use to see better.",
        "sectioneli5-25-2": "Shadows change shape throughout the day because the sun moves across the sky. In the morning, shadows are long; at noon, they are short or disappear; and in the afternoon, they lengthen again. This happens because sunlight travels in a straight line, which changes the shadows depending on where the sun is in the sky.",
        "sectioneli5-25-3": "Light comes from the sun and other things like bulbs. When light hits things, they can be three types: opaque, translucent, and transparent. Opaque objects do not let light through and create shadows, like cardboard. Translucent objects let a little light through, like frosted glass. And transparent objects let all the light through, like window glass. Shadows change shape with the sun because light travels in a straight line. In the morning and afternoon, they are long, and at noon, they are short.",
        "sectioneli5-26-0": "The text teaches about light and shadow. It tells us that the Sun is like a big natural lamp that gives us light and heat. This is like saying that the Sun is the source or the place from which all the light and heat we feel on Earth come.",
        "sectioneli5-26-1": "When we talk about opaque objects, we refer to things that do not let light pass through. Think of them as a wall that does not allow light to pass to the other side, so if something is behind it, it will be in shadow. In the exercise, you must choose the option that says opaque bodies block light.",
        "sectioneli5-26-2": "When we think about sunlight, it is important to know that it travels in straight lines, like when you throw a ball in a straight line and it follows its path. This means that light moves directly from the Sun to objects on Earth without making curves.",
        "sectioneli5-27-0": "The Sun is a star, which means it is an object in space that shines with its own light. It is what gives us natural light and heat on Earth. There are other lights that humans have created, like light bulbs and candles, which are called artificial lights. Most of the things we see do not shine by themselves; they are visible because they reflect light from something that does, like the Sun.",
        "sectioneli5-27-1": "You should rewrite a sentence about the Sun using more information from the notebooks. For example, you could say: \"The Sun is a star (that is, a celestial body that shines with its own light).\" Use words like \"that is\" or \"in other words\" when expanding an idea, and pay close attention to how you use commas and parentheses.",
        "sectioneli5-28-0": "In this task, we are going to learn about things that give off light, called light sources. Some are natural, like the sun and the stars, because they are there without us making them. Others are artificial, like a flashlight or an electric lamp, which are things we create to have light. Think about when you see these types of light and how they help us see everything around us.",
        "sectioneli5-28-1": "There are different types of light and bodies that let it pass. Light sources can be natural, such as the sun and stars, or artificial, like a lamp or a candle. Opaque bodies do not let light pass through. There are others, like frosted glass, that allow light to pass through and let us see through them clearly.",
        "sectioneli5-29-0": "You have to help fix a text that has errors. You need to separate the words that are stuck together, capitalize the beginning of sentences, and use punctuation marks like periods and commas. The image shows how you can use your hands to create shadows on the wall, making shapes like animals. It's very fun to practice! Additionally, it makes it easier to understand how light and shadows work.",
        "sectioneli5-30-0": "Chinese shadow puppets are a fun and old game where you use your hands and a light to make figures on the wall. You can make shadows that look like ducks, rabbits, or snakes. If you keep your hands still, the figure doesn't move. But if you move your fingers, the figures can seem to be alive and moving. It's like doing magic with shadows using only your hands.",
        "sectioneli5-30-1": "First, read the text about Chinese shadows again. Then, talk to your classmates to see which words are repeated and how to improve the text. After that, write your ideas to change it in a draft and, finally, make your corrected version of the text here.",
