When the humid ocean wind reaches these mountains, it drops its 'water' on one side, making it very green, while the other side remains dry. The mountains also have different 'floors', and at higher altitudes, the plants and animals that live there change.

        "sectioneli5-18-2": "First, you have to look at two images of mountains and the surrounding weather. Image A shows a mountain with wind and rain on one side, where forests grow because it's humid. On the other side, it is dry, with fewer plants. Image B shows how a mountain has: the top part called the summit, the side called the slope, and the bottom part called the base.\n\nYou need to indicate which image better explains how wind and rain affect mountains.

We also need to think about the type of plants and animals that live there.\n\nAdditionally, there is a diagram we use to put words that help us describe the biomes, like temperature and the type of soil. In this way, we can better understand how these special places around the world are.",
        "sectioneli5-20-1": "When we talk about biomes, we are learning about different parts of nature, such as forests or grasslands. To understand them well, we look at important factors, such as the type of soil (if it is sandy, for example) and the temperature (whether it's hot or cold). These factors help us know what the place is like and what plants and animals live there.",

Things like the climate (whether it's hot or cold) and the soil (the earth) help this neighborhood function.

So, a biome is a natural place where everything is connected like a big team.",

This can cause the environment to change a lot, sometimes even damaging it greatly. It is important to understand how our actions can change the world where we live.",
        "sectioneli5-24-0": "Biomes are large areas where animals and plants live and where certain activities are carried out. \n\nIn the **savanna**, it is hot and there is a lot of rain sometimes and little rain other times. Animals like jaguars and deer live there, and people do things like grow food and raise animals.\n\nIn the **desert**, it is very hot and it hardly ever rains. The plants that live here, such as cacti, are special because they can live without much water. In this place, they also search for minerals in the soil.",

        "sectioneli5-26-0": "There are some people who care a lot about taking care of the planet. For example, Wangari Maathai planted many trees to help her country in Africa. Chico Mendes protected the forests in Brazil so that they would not be destroyed. Jacques Cousteau explored the oceans so that people would know how important they are. And the Inuit in the Arctic work to protect their home from harm. They all did special things to take care of the Earth.",

        "sectioneli5-27-2": "A slogan is like a magical and easy-to-remember phrase. It is used to make people think of something special. For example, when we say \"You are the air that I breathe,\" we are saying that it is important to care for trees because they help us breathe. It is a message that makes us want to plant trees to keep the air clean.",
        "sectioneli5-28-0": "When we speak or write, we use special words called pronouns to indicate who is doing something, such as \"I\" or \"we\". Verbs are the words that indicate the action, like \"play\" or \"run\". Each pronoun has its own version of the verb. For example, \"I play\" and \"we play\". Therefore, it is important to match the correct pronoun with its verb so that the sentence makes sense.",
        "sectioneli5-28-1": "Here we are going to play with words to complete a small story. We have to use special words called verbs, and adjust them to match who is doing the action. For example:\n\n1. If I do something, we say 'I take charge'.\n2. If we talk about a group like 'we', we say 'we bring'.\n3. When it is 'they', we use 'they can'.\n\nWe use each verb differently depending on whom we are referring to, like me, you, us, or them. It's like putting the right pieces in a puzzle! Look at the images and follow the examples to complete the story correctly.",
        "sectioneli5-28-2": "Personal pronouns are words we use to talk about different people. For example, when I say 'I', I'm talking about myself. If I say 'you', I'm talking to the person I am speaking with. 'He' or 'she' are used to talk about someone else. If there is more than one person, we use 'we' to include myself and 'you' or 'they' for other people. They are useful for better communication! The table in the image shows us how to use them in different situations.",
        "sectioneli5-28-3": "In this activity, we are learning how verbs change according to the person who performs the action. Imagine each verb is like a chameleon that changes color depending on who is using it: if I, you, he, we, you all, or they. For example, the verb 'generate' changes to 'generate' when we talk about them. The fun part is to find more verbs and change them too. It's like a word puzzle game!",

This is a type of energy made from plants or food waste, like when we talk about green things or recycling.\n\n4. It is a place where there is a special kind of plants, like a jungle with many trees or a desert with sand.\n\n5. It is a book that tells everything that has happened in someone's life, like a very detailed diary.\n\nFollowing these clues, you will be able to fill in the crossword.",
        "sectioneli5-30-1": "All these words have common parts, like 'bi-' and 'biblio-', which help to create new meanings when combined with other parts. This also helps to spell them correctly. For example, 'biblioteca' and 'bibliobús' use 'biblio-' because they are related to books. So, these parts function like special ingredients that combine to make new words with related meanings.",
        "sectioneli5-30-3": "In this activity, we learn about little parts at the beginning of some words called \"composite elements\" or prefixes. For example, \"bi-\" which means two, and \"biblio-\" which means book. When you attach them to other words, like \"monthly\", they form \"bimonthly\", which means every two months. They are always written with 'b'.",
        "sectioneli5-30-4": "The prefix 'bi-' means two, as in 'bicolor', which means two colors. 'Biblio-' comes from 'book', as in 'library', which is where there are many books.
