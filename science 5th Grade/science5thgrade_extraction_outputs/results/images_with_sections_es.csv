13,img-13-2,True,science5thgrade_extraction_outputs/images_cropped/13_img-13-2.png,Images are reviewed for their educational value in the context of the textbook. Images showing landscapes or concepts related to the topic are considered meaningful. Images like pure colors or small decorative items are not.,1.0,text_and_images,es,"Una isla volcánica con humo saliendo del cráter, rodeada por el mar.","The image depicts an island with volcanic activity, emphasizing the dynamic interactions within Earth's systems as discussed in the textbook page."
15,img-15-2,True,science5thgrade_extraction_outputs/images_cropped/15_img-15-2.png,"Image img-15-1 is a decorative image and not directly related to the educational content. Image img-15-2 illustrates the 'Ring of Fire' which is meaningful to the educational context. Image img-15-3 is purely textual and decorative, not meaningful as an image. Image img-15-4 is a simple block of color and deemed decorative.",0.0,text_and_images,es,"Mapa que muestra los volcanes activos, tectónica de placas y el ""Anillo de Fuego"" en el océano Pacífico.","The image is a map highlighting the ""Ring of Fire,"" a path of active volcanoes and frequent earthquakes around the Pacific Ocean. It typically shows tectonic plates and volcanic activity."
18,img-18-2,True,science5thgrade_extraction_outputs/images_cropped/18_img-18-2.png,"The first image (img-18-1) seems to be more decorative as it is a cover image and doesn't convey educational content related to the text. The second image (img-18-2) is a map depicting the Ring of Fire, which is directly related to the educational content, making it meaningful. The crop coordinates are provided to exclude any additional non-essential elements while retaining the full educational aspect.",0.0,text_and_images,es,"Mapa del Anillo de Fuego, mostrando áreas de actividad volcánica y sísmica en el Océano Pacífico.","The contextual text references the Ring of Fire, a path along the Pacific with volcanic activity and earthquakes. The map image marks the location with red lines and labels, correlating with the described geological features."
19,img-19-2,True,science5thgrade_extraction_outputs/images_cropped/19_img-19-2.png,"The first image, 'img-19-1', appears to be a cover image with decorative flowers and text, not directly related to educational content regarding earthquakes or ocean floor tectonics. It's decorative and can be considered not meaningful for the content on the page. The second image, 'img-19-2', is highly meaningful as it directly pertains to the topic of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge discussed in the accompanying text, but minor text needs to be cropped to focus on the image itself.",1.0,text_and_images,es,"Valle de fisura en Islandia, parte de la Dorsal Mesoatlántica, cubierto de nieve y flanqueado por paredes de roca.","The image shows a geological feature that's common with tectonic activities, as indicated by the context concerning the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

20,img-20-2,True,science5thgrade_extraction_outputs/images_cropped/20_img-20-2.png,I examined each image from the textbook page. Meaningful images include those that depict relevant educational content such as maps and diagrams. Images that are purely decorative or contain mostly text with no educational illustrations are not considered meaningful.,0.0,text_and_images,es,"Mapa que muestra volcanes activos, tectónica de placas y el ""Cinturón de Fuego"" del Pacífico.",The image shows a map highlighting active volcanoes and plate tectonics with a focus on the Pacific 'Ring of Fire'. This map is related to the text's topic regarding volcanic activity and tectonics.
23,img-23-2,True,science5thgrade_extraction_outputs/images_cropped/23_img-23-2.png,"Images 1 and 3 appear to be decorative or introductory, while Image 2 is educational with meaningful content. Image 3 is a simple graphic element, possibly for page design.",0.0,text_and_images,es,Diagrama que muestra que el 97% del agua en la Tierra es salada y el 3% es dulce.,"The image shows a diagram indicating the distribution of Earth's water, highlighting the percentage of salty and fresh water. Providing this context in Spanish fulfills the captioning request."
25,img-25-2,True,science5thgrade_extraction_outputs/images_cropped/25_img-25-2.png,"The first image ('img-25-1') is purely decorative with flowers, making it meaningful in a general context but less relevant for a textbook focused on Earth's water. The second image ('img-25-2'), showing water droplets and ripples, goes well with the content of Earth's water. The last three images are decorative or too abstract to provide educational value relevant to the page content.",0.0,text_and_images,es,"Una gota de agua cayendo sobre una superficie, creando ondas.","The image is showing a close-up of a water droplet creating ripples on a water surface, which is relevant to the section about comparing saltwater and freshwater. This would symbolically represent freshwater."
26,img-26-2,True,science5thgrade_extraction_outputs/images_cropped/26_img-26-2.png,The reasoning involves recognizing the context and significance of the images based on their content.,0.0,text_and_images,es,"Gráfico sobre la distribución del agua en la Tierra, destacando la proporción de agua salada y dulce, y el desglose de esta última en glaciares, agua subterránea y cuerpos de agua como lagos y ríos.","The chart shows the distribution of Earth's water, focusing on how much is freshwater compared to saltwater and the details of where freshwater is located, such as in glaciers, groundwater, and lakes. This data is critical for understanding water resources."
28,img-28-2,True,science5thgrade_extraction_outputs/images_cropped/28_img-28-2.png,"The first image (img-28-1) is purely decorative and doesn't contain educational content, making it not meaningful in this context. The second image (img-28-2) contains informative content about water distribution on Earth, making it meaningful. The third image (img-28-3) is purely decorative, showing a solid color, therefore not meaningful.",0.0,text_and_images,es,"Diagrama que muestra que el 97% del agua en la Tierra es salada, mientras que solo el 3% es dulce, distribuido en glaciares, agua subterránea y agua superficial.","The main point of the image is to show the proportion of saltwater and freshwater on Earth. It provides percentages and a visual representation that aids understanding of how water is distributed, emphasizing that the majority is saline."
