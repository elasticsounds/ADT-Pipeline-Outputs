13,img-13-2,True,science5thgrade_extraction_outputs/images_cropped/13_img-13-2.png,Images are reviewed for their educational value in the context of the textbook. Images showing landscapes or concepts related to the topic are considered meaningful. Images like pure colors or small decorative items are not.,1.0,text_and_images,en,"A volcanic island with visible smoke and steam rising, demonstrating interactions between Earth's geosphere and atmosphere.","Based on the image and context from the textbook page, the picture features a volcanic island with visible gases and steam emanating from the crater, highlighting interactions between Earth's systems such as volcanic activity. The textbook section relates to understanding Earth's features and the interactions within its major systems, like the geosphere and atmosphere."
15,img-15-2,True,science5thgrade_extraction_outputs/images_cropped/15_img-15-2.png,"Image img-15-1 is a decorative image and not directly related to the educational content. Image img-15-2 illustrates the 'Ring of Fire' which is meaningful to the educational context. Image img-15-3 is purely textual and decorative, not meaningful as an image. Image img-15-4 is a simple block of color and deemed decorative.",0.0,text_and_images,en,"A map illustrating active volcanoes and tectonic plates, highlighting the ""Ring of Fire"" in the Pacific Ocean.",The image is a map showing the 'Ring of Fire' around the Pacific Ocean where active volcanoes are located. It also labels various tectonic plates.
18,img-18-2,True,science5thgrade_extraction_outputs/images_cropped/18_img-18-2.png,"The first image (img-18-1) seems to be more decorative as it is a cover image and doesn't convey educational content related to the text. The second image (img-18-2) is a map depicting the Ring of Fire, which is directly related to the educational content, making it meaningful. The crop coordinates are provided to exclude any additional non-essential elements while retaining the full educational aspect.",0.0,text_and_images,en,"A map illustrating the Pacific Ring of Fire, displaying tectonic plate boundaries and volcanic activity zones around the Pacific Ocean.","The image is a map showing volcanic and seismic activity zones in the Pacific, known as the Ring of Fire. It highlights tectonic plate boundaries and related geological features, which correspond to the textbook explanation."
19,img-19-2,True,science5thgrade_extraction_outputs/images_cropped/19_img-19-2.png,"The first image, 'img-19-1', appears to be a cover image with decorative flowers and text, not directly related to educational content regarding earthquakes or ocean floor tectonics. It's decorative and can be considered not meaningful for the content on the page. The second image, 'img-19-2', is highly meaningful as it directly pertains to the topic of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge discussed in the accompanying text, but minor text needs to be cropped to focus on the image itself.",1.0,text_and_images,en,A rift valley covered in snow at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in Iceland.,"The image represents a geological feature, specifically a rift valley, which could be linked to plate tectonics. The accompanying text identifies this as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in Iceland."
20,img-20-2,True,science5thgrade_extraction_outputs/images_cropped/20_img-20-2.png,I examined each image from the textbook page. Meaningful images include those that depict relevant educational content such as maps and diagrams. Images that are purely decorative or contain mostly text with no educational illustrations are not considered meaningful.,0.0,text_and_images,en,"Map showing active volcanoes along tectonic plate boundaries, highlighting the ""Ring of Fire.""","The image is a map highlighting tectonic plates, active volcanoes, and the ""Ring of Fire"" with labels indicating regions like the Pacific Plate and several others."

Image 3 is a simple graphic element, possibly for page design.",0.0,text_and_images,en,"Diagram showing Earth's water distribution: 97% saltwater (oceans) and 3% freshwater, with breakdown of freshwater sources.","The image illustrates the distribution of Earth's water, highlighting that 97% is saltwater and only 3% is freshwater. This data is relevant for discussions on water resources."
25,img-25-2,True,science5thgrade_extraction_outputs/images_cropped/25_img-25-2.png,"The first image ('img-25-1') is purely decorative with flowers, making it meaningful in a general context but less relevant for a textbook focused on Earth's water. The second image ('img-25-2'), showing water droplets and ripples, goes well with the content of Earth's water. The last three images are decorative or too abstract to provide educational value relevant to the page content.",0.0,text_and_images,en,A droplet of water creating ripples on a water surface.,"The image clearly shows a droplet of water causing ripples. This fits the theme of Earth's water distribution discussed in the textbook context, demonstrating the properties and presence of water."
26,img-26-2,True,science5thgrade_extraction_outputs/images_cropped/26_img-26-2.png,The reasoning involves recognizing the context and significance of the images based on their content.,0.0,text_and_images,en,"A chart illustrating the distribution of Earth's water, with 96.5% in oceans, 2.5% as freshwater, and the remainder as other saline water. Freshwater is mostly in glaciers and ice caps (68.7%), with ground ice, permafrost, lakes, rivers, and living organisms accounting for smaller amounts.","The chart depicts the distribution of water on Earth, categorizing it into total global water, freshwater, and surface and other freshwater. It gives specific percentages for each category, indicating the scarcity of freshwater resources."

The second image (img-28-2) contains informative content about water distribution on Earth, making it meaningful. The third image (img-28-3) is purely decorative, showing a solid color, therefore not meaningful.",0.0,text_and_images,en,"Diagram showing Earth's water distribution: 97% saltwater in oceans and 3% freshwater, mostly in icecaps and glaciers, with smaller portions in ground water and surface water.","The image provides a visual representation of the distribution of water on Earth, differentiating between saltwater and freshwater. The percentages and categories of fresh water sources are explicitly shown."
