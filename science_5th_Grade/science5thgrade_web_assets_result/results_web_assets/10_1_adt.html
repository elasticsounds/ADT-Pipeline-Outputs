                    If the standard includes the idea of designing, then the design process will contain components of defining the problem (along with identifying the criteria and constraints), developing many possible solutions, and optimizing a solution (e.g., determining a best solution for the situation based on the criteria and constraints, testing the solution, refining the solution).
