<strong>Analyze and interpret data</strong> to describe <em>patterns</em> of Earth’s features. Emphasize
                most earthquakes and volcanoes occur in bands that are often along the boundaries between continents and
                oceans while major mountain chains may be found inside continents or near their edges. Examples of data
                could include maps showing locations of mountains on continents and the ocean floor or the locations of
                volcanoes and earthquakes. (ESS2.B)

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Volcanoes, Earthquakes, and Ocean Floor</h3>
<h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Volcanoes</h4>
<p>Volcanoes are openings in the Earth’s crust that allow hot, melted rock (magma), ash, and gases to
                    erupt outward. Volcanoes change the Earth’s surface in a short period of time. More than half of
                    Earth’s surface is made up of volcanic rock. Volcanoes are evidence that we live on an active,
                    changing planet.</p>
<p>Do you know how a volcano forms? Far below Earth’s surface, temperatures are hot enough to melt rock.
                    The melted rock comes out of cracks in the Earth’s crust, resulting in a volcano. Some eruptions pour
                    out rivers of lava while other volcanoes have larger eruptions. Volcanoes can erupt underwater,
                    forming huge ranges of volcanic mountains on the ocean floor.</p>

<div class="my-6">
<h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Pacific Ring of Fire</h4>
<p>Most earthquakes and volcanic eruptions take place along the edges of the Pacific Ocean (see image
                    below). The Earth’s crust is broken up into a series of massive sections called plates. The movements
                    of these plates can account for noticeable changes to the Earth, such as earthquakes, volcanic
                    eruptions, and the building of mountains.</p>
